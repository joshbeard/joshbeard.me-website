See my [now page](/now/) for a summary of what I'm up to lately.

### Personal

I'm a somewhat private and introverted person, especially online, so having a
personal website isn't something I expect to excel at. I'd prefer my name and
"brand" be mostly professional and avoid particularly opinionated content,
especially about politics, reglion, social issues, etc. It's exhausting to see
everyone's stance on everything anymore, front and center and often in an
antagonistic way and increasingly polarizing and divisive. I may try to write
other content just to have a website - casual stuff, technical, or artsy, even
if no one is looking.

If you are looking at this and dig personal websites and that sort of thing,
say [hello](mailto:hello@joshbeard.me)! It'd be really cool to exchange a
"postcard" of sorts with people in e-mail.

I live in Colorado Springs, Colorado. I enjoy time with family, computers,
outdoors (hiking, scenic drives), music
([listening](https://www.last.fm/user/hewbert), watching, playing), food
(mostly just eating), games (card, party, board), and all sorts of other stuff.

### Professional Life

I got my professional "foot in the door" of systems administration at a school
district several years ago. At that point, I had already been running common
services on Linux and FreeBSD for years for all sorts of things and had some
coding experience - at least shell, PHP, and web stuff. In that role, I really
honed my coding skills and gained experience with several types of services,
particularly e-mail services, file services, LDAP, and HTTP. There, I learned
about Puppet and configuration management, which launched me into a new phase of
my career - 'DevOps'.

```

These days I work in a "DevOps and Sysadmin" role - I provide and maintain the
IT platform for dozens of applications and product teams as well as the build and
deployment process for those applications and services, using automation and
code.

I spend most of my day in a code editor and command-line, bouncing across
several projects. The type of code I am typically working with is Terraform,
Python, Ansible, Puppet, Shell, YAML and JSON, and an assortment of others on
occassion. I work with AWS, Docker, and GitLab a lot.

See [my resume](/resume/) for more details about my professional experience.

### The Good ol' Days

I've been a computer hobbyist since I was a kid/teen in the mid-late 90's, starting with
our [obsolete family computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PC_compatible_systems)
bought from a garage sale, the next family computer, and several other outdated
computers I collected from people back then.

```

I took an interest in Linux and Free and Open Source Software around 1999 and
became particuarily interested in setting up and administering servers and
websites. I've continued to use Linux every day, both professionally and as a
hobbiest.

In the early 2000's, I started using FreeBSD more and ran it for several years
on my desktop and home servers, eventually using it professionally at one of my
previous jobs.

I owe my career to Free and Open Source Software and the ecosystem
built around Linux and UNIX.

### Computers Over The Years

I haven't really kept track of the computers I've used over the
years. A summarized list is below - I may not have the exact model in a couple
of cases, but what's listed is pretty close. Between 1998 and 2004, my friends
and I acquired an assortment of parts, traded them, and built our own (obsolete)
computers from a pile of parts.

As my professional life has developed, I'm mostly just using work-issued
MacBooks day-to-day and an older, but reliable and usable, MacBook Air.

* [Commodore PC Compatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PC_compatible_systems) (owned 1996). Ran MS-DOS. Played basic games, joined BBS.
* [Packard Bell Pentium II 133MHz](http://pbplanet.info/wiki/index.php/Multimedia_D136) (1995-2000) Hung out on a [BBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system), Played games like [Duke Nukem 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem_3D) and [Sim City 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity_2000). Windows 95, 98, 2000. Later installed [Red Hat Linux 5.2](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/press-redhatlinux52), bought off a shelf at  a Wal-Mart, and tested other Linux distributions.
* [Zenith SupersPort 286](https://oldcrap.org/2020/10/30/zenith-supersport-286e/) (1989; owned 1997-98) Mostly used MS-DOS and kept a journal on it. Windows 3.0 installed.
* Several no-name [386](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386) and [486s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I486) (1997-2005). Ran mostly DOS. Installed Windows 95 from floppy on a 486. Also ran Linux and FreeBSD on these over the years.
* Several no-name [Pentiums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_(original)) and [AMD K5/K6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Micro_Devices#CPUs_and_APUs) (1999-2005). Ran Linux and FreeBSD.
* [Dell Inspiron 1750](https://rmromero.blogspot.com/2010/04/dell-inspiron-17-1750-specifications.html)(?) Laptop. (2005-2011) Windows XP, Linux (Gentoo, Ubuntu), and FreeBSD.
* [Asus Eee PC 900](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_Eee_PC#Eee_900_series). (2010-2012) Ran Linux (Debian) and FreeBSD.
* Asus Netbook. (2012-2013). Ran Linux (Ubuntu)
* [Apple MacBook Air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air). (2015 - Present). Runs macOS.
* Several Work-issued [iMacs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac) (2008-2010). macOS.
* Several Work-issued [MacBooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook). Runs macOS. Used Linux on MacBooks 2010-2013.

Many of these were used as home servers over the years. I ran my own e-mail
servers at home for several years, along with web servers and an assortment of
other things. I hosted e-mail and web content for myself mostly, but had a few
users over the years and a couple of niche projects related to customizing
desktop environments. I used FreeBSD on most of my home servers from 2004-2020,
along with an occasional Linux box.

I started using Linux on my desktop around 2000 and continued to until I started
exploring FreeBSD, which I ran on most of my workstations from 2004-2007. From there,
It's been a mix of more Linux and macOS on my workstations.

#### Home Servers

My current home server is a Dell PowerEdge T410, bought off eBay.
I'm running [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) on it with several virtual
machines and [LXC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC)
containers.

Some services I run are [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/), [Plex Media Server](https://www.plex.tv/),
[Transmission BitTorrent](https://transmissionbt.com/),
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/),
[Nginx](https://nginx.org/),
[Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/),
[K3s](https://k3s.io/),
and some other odds and ends.

I manage it all with code, mostly Ansible and Terraform, with automated image
templates and GitLab CI/CD.

I host my Gemini, Gopher, and Finger services on it in containers. See my
[Small Internet](/site/small.html) page for more information.
