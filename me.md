## About Josh Beard

{% include submenu.html %}

See my [now page](/now) for a summary of what I'm up to lately.

### Personal

I'm a somewhat private and introverted person, especially online, so having a
personal website isn't something I expect to excel at. I'd prefer my name and
"brand" be mostly professional and avoid particularly opinionated content,
especially about politics, reglion, social issues, etc. There's enough people
putting that front and center and often in an antagonistic way that's
increasingly polarizing and divisive. I may try to write other content just to
have something to call a _website_ - casual stuff, technical, or artsy, even if
no one is looking. It's tradition and what has led me into my career.

If you are looking at this and dig personal websites and that sort of thing,
say [hello](mailto:hello@joshbeard.me)! It'd be really cool to exchange a
"postcard" of sorts with people in e-mail.

I live in [Colorado Springs, Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs%2C_Colorado).
I enjoy time with family, computers, outdoors (hiking, scenic drives), music
([listening](https://www.last.fm/user/hewbert), watching, playing), food
(mostly just eating), games (card, party, board), and all sorts of other stuff.

I consider [Rapid City, South Dakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_City%2C_South_Dakota) my home.
I was born in and have family and roots in [Northeasten Arkansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Delta),
with most of my parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents generations around
Southeast Missouri, and Tennessee.  I hardly know anything about my family
history or ancestry. I've lived in Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Kansas,
Missouri, and South Dakota.

### Professional Life

I was doing hobbyist stuff with servers and web apps in virtually all of my free
time prior to getting a career doing it. I joined the Army and did some level of
IT administration as part of my duties, but not so much traditional systems
administration or development. I later worked for Apple doing support and loved
any opportunity to use the UNIX underpinnings of their platform.

I got my real professional "foot in the door" of systems administration at a
school district several years ago. At that point, I had already been running
common services on Linux and FreeBSD for years for all sorts of things and had
some coding experience - at least shell, PHP, and web stuff. In that role, I
really honed my coding skills and gained experience with several types of
services, particularly e-mail services, file services, LDAP, and HTTP. There, I
learned Puppet, configuration management, version control, and lots of other
things, which launched me into a new phase of my career - 'DevOps'.

```

These days I work in a "DevOps and Sysadmin" role - I provide and maintain the
IT platform for dozens of applications and product teams as well as the build and
deployment process for those applications and services, using automation and
code.

I spend most of my day in a code editor and command-line, bouncing across
several projects. The type of code I am typically working with is Terraform,
Python, Ansible, Puppet, Shell, YAML and JSON, and an assortment of others on
occassion. I work with AWS, Docker, and GitLab a lot. See my [uses page](/uses)
for more information about what I use day-to-day.

I've been a computer hobbyist since I was a kid/teen in the mid-late 90's, starting with
our [obsolete family computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PC_compatible_systems)
bought from a garage sale, the next family computer, and several other outdated
computers I collected from people back then.

I took an interest in Linux and Free and Open Source Software around 1999 and
became particuarily interested in setting up and administering servers and
websites. I've continued to use Linux every day, both professionally and as a
hobbiest.

In the early 2000's, I started using FreeBSD more and ran it for several years
on my desktop and home servers, eventually using it professionally at one of my
previous jobs.

I owe my career to Free and Open Source Software and the ecosystem
built around Linux and UNIX.
