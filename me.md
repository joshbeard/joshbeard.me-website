### Personal

I'm a somewhat private and introverted person, especially online, so having a
personal website isn't something I expect to excel at. I'd prefer my name and
"brand" be mostly professional and avoid particularly opinionated content,
especially about politics, reglion, social issues, etc. It's exhausting to see
everyone's stance on everything anymore, front and center and often in an
antagonistic way and increasingly polarizing and divisive. I may try to write
other content just to have a website - casual stuff, technical, or artsy, even
if no one is looking.

If you are looking at this and dig personal websites and that sort of thing,
say [hello](mailto:hello@joshbeard.me)! It'd be really cool to exchange a
"postcard" of sorts with people in e-mail.

I live in Colorado Springs, Colorado. I enjoy time with family, computers,
outdoors (hiking, scenic drives), music
([listening](https://www.last.fm/user/hewbert), watching, playing), food
(mostly just eating), games (card, party, board), and all sorts of other stuff.

### The Good ol' Days

I've been a computer hobbyist since I was a kid in the mid 90's, starting with
our obsolete family computer bought from a garage sale, the next family
computer, and several other vintage computers I collected from people back then.

I took an interest in Linux and Free and Open Source Software around 1999 and
became particuarily interested in setting up and administering servers and
websites. I've continued to use Linux every day, both professionally and as a
hobbiest.

In the early 2000's, I started using FreeBSD more and ran it for several years
on my desktop and home servers, eventually using it professionally at one of my
previous jobs.

I owe my career to Free and Open Source Software and the ecosystem
built around Linux and UNIX.

### Professional Life

I got my professional "foot in the door" of systems administration at a school
district several years ago. At that point, I had already been running common
services on Linux and FreeBSD for years for all sorts of things and had some
coding experience - at least shell, PHP, and web stuff. In that role, I really
honed my coding skills and gained experience with several types of services,
particularly e-mail services, file services, LDAP, and HTTP. There, I learned
about Puppet and configuration management, which launched me into a new phase of
my career - 'DevOps'.

These days I work in a "DevOps and Sysadmin" role - I provide and maintain the
IT platform for dozens of applications and product teams as well as the build and
deployment process for those applications and services, using automation and
code.

I spend most of my day in a code editor and command-line, bouncing across
several projects. The type of code I am typically working with is Terraform,
Python, Ansible, Puppet, Shell, YAML and JSON, and an assortment of others on
occassion. I work with AWS, Docker, and GitLab a lot.

See my [resume](/resume/) for more details about my professional experience.
