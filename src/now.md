## What I'm Up To Now

{% include submenu.html %}

This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). I'll try to update it every
few months.

This is what I'm doing as of January 2025:

* Raising two daughters with my wife in [Colorado Springs, CO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs%2C_Colorado).
* Working on some home improvement projects.
* Getting into shape after years of neglect.
* Programming in Go a lot.
