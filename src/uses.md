## What I Use

{% include submenu.html %}

This is my [uses page](https://uses.tech/).

It nags at my security conscience to publish information about software and
equipment I use but in the spirit of community, here it is. It ain't like
there's super unique config going on here. Almost seems like it should be a
"useless" page.

### Desk

__TODO:__ Add photos here.

I have a dedicated humble office space and a workbench in my garage. I don't
always keep it tidy, I don't have a bunch of cool, coordinated gear. I bought
my desk used from an online ad - it's one of the good ol' SteelCase office
desks. I severely injured my toe hauling that thing into my basement and think
it's now permanently down there.

I mostly use a shop workbench in my garage with the door wide open when the
weather is decent enough. Working like this has been fantastic for wellbeing,
although the height of the workbench and the availability of good seating isn't
great.

### Computers

I've always ran on older, used computers. I bought a brand new computer once in
my life.

I've been a Linux user since 1999 or so, with a few years of running FreeBSD.
I've used macOS a lot at work since 2008, along with an occassional Linux
workstation. Briefly got stuck using Windows 11 at work and hated it. Ads built
into the desktop? Insane anyone puts up with that crap, but WSL2 wasn't bad.

* MacBook Pro (2015) 13" Retina i7 3.1GHz/16GB. Arch Linux full time, but dual
  boot macOS. A little quriky, but it's a workhorse.
  Daily driver.
* MacBook Pro M1 (work). Runs macOS. Daily Driver.
* Keyboard: [Logitech MX Mechanical Mini](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/mx-mechanical.html)
  * I've had this for well over a year now and am still pretty pleased with it.
* Monitors: Phillips 32" 4k UHD curved, 2x Viewsonic 22" IPS 1080p, 2x
  Viewsonic 24" IPS 1080p.

### Homelab

See my [Home Lab](/homelab) page for more information.

* Dell PowerEdge T410 (Runs Proxmox on Debian) - LXC, VM, Docker with a mix of Linux distributions and BSD. Mostly [Rocky
  Linux](https://rockylinux.org/)
* Shuttle DS87 (i3 3.6GHz/16GB) - Not used yet, but plan to use [OPNSense](https://opnsense.org/)
  * Over a year later and it's still sitting in the basement with assorted
    cables stacked on top.
* Dell Wyse 3040 (Thin client - Atom x5/2GB) - [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/)
  * Love this little thing.
* other hardware running Linux and BSD.
* Homelab OS: Linux (Rocky, Ubuntu, Debian, Alpine), OpenBSD, FreeBSD

The [My Old Computers](/old-computers.html) page lists some older computers
I've had.

### Music

* [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/joshbeard)
* [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/hewbert007?si=52f6e599773a4cab)

### Software

* Browsers: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and
  [Brave](https://brave.com).
* Shell: zsh with [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto).
* Notes: [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.app/)
* [Mutt](http://www.mutt.org/) for an e-mail client.
* [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) and
  [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/). I've tried many terminals over the years
  and really don't mind any of them with a decent config and color scheme.

### Development and Work

* I generally prefer and will defend 80 character width. It's much more
  readable, you can fit more documents on screen without wrapping, and sort of
  keeps you in check on whether a block of code is getting wild. I've recently
  started using 100 character width more, but feel dirty.
* [neovim](https://neovim.io/). Long-time VIM user from 2000-2019. Used
  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  (with the VIM plugin, of course) for a couple of years at work.
* [Docker](https://docker.io). [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/) at
  work.
* Terraform
* Go
* AWS
* Shell
* Ansible (previous gigs and at home)
* Python
* Lots of GitLab CI and GitHub workflows
* tmux
* [draw.io](https://draw.io/) for diagrams, flowcharts, etc.
* [google-webfonts-helper](https://colorslurp.com/) for downloading and serving Google web fonts locally
* [Hack monospace font](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/)
* See my [dotfiles](https://github.com/joshbeard/dotfiles)

### Desktop Utilities

* Linux: using i3, i3status, i3bar.
* mac: [itsycal](https://www.mowglii.com/itsycal/): tiny menu bar calendar for macOS
* mac: [Contexts](https://contexts.co/): window and task switcher for macOS
* mac: [Magnet](https://magnet.crowdcafe.com/): window manager for macOS
* mac: [Amphetimine](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12): keep-awake utility for macOS
* mac: [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/): menu bar management for macOS
* mac: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): package manager (I only use it on Mac)

### Homelab

[Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/) as a platform.

Also see my [About this site](/site) and [Small Internet](/site/small.html) pages for other stuff I'm using for serving this site and
related materials.
