## What I Use

{% include submenu.html %}

This is my [uses page](https://uses.tech/).

It nags at my security conscience to publish information about software and
equipment I use but in the spirit of community, here it is. It ain't like
there's super unique config going on here. Almost seems like it should be a
"useless" page.

### Desk

__TODO:__ Add photos here.

I have a dedicated humble office space and a workbench in my garage that I
float between, depending on the weather. I don't always keep it tidy, I don't
have a bunch of cool, coordinated gear. I bought my desk used from an online ad
- it's one of the good ol' SteelCase office desks. I severely injured my toe
  hauling that thing into my basement and think it's now permanently down
  there.

### Computers

I've always ran on older, used computers. I bought a brand new computer once in
my life.

I've been a Linux user since 1999 or so, with a few years of running FreeBSD,
starting around 2004. I've used macOS a lot at work since 2008, along with an
occassional Linux workstation. Briefly got stuck using Windows 11 at work and
hated it. Ads built into the desktop? Insane anyone puts up with that crap, but
WSL2 wasn't bad. My opinion of Microsoft has and will always be low - I was
a Linux geek in the early 2000s and they were overtly hostile to Linux and
open source.

* MacBook Pro (2015) 13" Retina i7 3.1GHz/16GB. Arch Linux full time, but dual
  boot macOS for LogicPro sometimes. A little quriky, but it's a workhorse and
  outperforms my newer M1 running macOS most days.
* MacBook Pro M1 (work). Runs macOS. Daily Driver. I've started to dislike
  macOS quite a bit for getting work done, after using it over the last 14
  years. I still pine for the day I can actually use Linux on my workstation at
  work. I've administered thousands of Linux servers across jobs, but for some
  reason it's never blessed for the desktop :(
* Keyboard: I've been using the [NuPhy Air75](https://nuphy.com/products/air75)
  since February 2024 and now have a couple of them with different switches.
  I was using a [Logitech MX Mechanical Mini](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/mx-mechanical.html)
  previously, which I wasn't complely happy with after a while. A required
  feature for me is multi-device support and a USB receiver - I don't use
  Bluethooth on my Linux box (battery sucks enough as it is).
* Monitors: Phillips 32" 4k UHD curved, 2x Viewsonic 22" IPS 1080p, 2x
  Viewsonic 24" IPS 1080p.

Checkout my [Old Computers page](/old-computers.html) for past computers I've
had since the 1990s.

### Desktop

* [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), btw.
* [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/). Previously used i3.
* [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi).
* [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar).

### Homelab

* Dell PowerEdge T410 (Runs Proxmox on Debian) - LXC, VM, Docker with a mix of Linux distributions and BSD. Mostly [Rocky
  Linux](https://rockylinux.org/)
* Shuttle DS87 (i3 3.6GHz/16GB) - Not used yet, but plan to use [OPNSense](https://opnsense.org/)
  * Over a year later and it's still sitting in the basement with assorted
    cables stacked on top.
* Dell Wyse 3040 (Thin client - Atom x5/2GB) - [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/)
  * Love this little thing.
* other hardware running Linux and BSD.
* Homelab OS: Linux (Rocky, Ubuntu, Debian, Alpine), OpenBSD, FreeBSD

See my [Home Lab](/homelab) page for more information.

### Music

* [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/joshbeard)
* [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/hewbert007?si=52f6e599773a4cab)

### Software

* Browsers: [Brave](https://brave.com) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).
  Kind of sick of the Chrome-based browser monopoly.
* Shell: zsh with [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto).
* Notes: [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)
* [Mutt](https://mutt.org) and [NeoMutt](http://www.neomutt.org/) for an e-mail client.
* [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/). I've tried many terminals over the years
  and really don't mind any of them with a decent config and color scheme.

### Development and Work

* I generally prefer and will defend 80 character width. It's much more
  readable, you can fit more documents on screen without wrapping, and sort of
  keeps you in check on whether a block of code is getting wild. I've recently
  started using 100 character width more, but feel dirty.
* [neovim](https://neovim.io/). Long-time VIM user from 2000-2019. Used
  [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  (with the VIM plugin, of course) for a couple of years at work.
* [Docker](https://docker.io). [Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/) at
  work.
* Terraform
* Go
* AWS
* Shell
* Ansible (previous gigs and at home)
* Python
* Lots of GitLab CI and GitHub workflows
* tmux
* [draw.io](https://draw.io/) for diagrams, flowcharts, etc.
* [google-webfonts-helper](https://colorslurp.com/) for downloading and serving Google web fonts locally
* [Hack monospace font](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/)
* See my [dotfiles](https://github.com/joshbeard/dotfiles)
