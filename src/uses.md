## What I Use

{% include submenu.html %}

I had a [uses page](https://uses.tech/) here, but I frankly don't have anything
interesting to share here right now.

I've used Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS on my workstations over the years since
2000, with all sorts of window manager and desktop environment combinations. In
the early 2000's, I was more into desktop "ricing" and used FreeBSD and
different Linux distributions.

Most of my jobs have offered MacBooks for workstations for more than a decade,
so I've mostly been using macOS. My personal workstation was a MacBook Pro
running Arch for the last several years, but I recently switched to using an M4
MacBook Air with macOS for personal stuff.

See my [old computers](/old-computers.html) page for some nostalgia.
