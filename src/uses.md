## What I Use

{% include submenu.html %}

This is my [uses page](https://uses.tech/).

It nags at my security conscience to publish information about software and
equipment I use but in the spirit of community, here it is. It ain't like
there's super unique config going on here.

### Desk

__TODO:__ Add photos here.

I have a dedicated humble office space and a workbench in my garage. I don't
always keep it tidy, I don't have a bunch of cool, coordinated gear. I bought
my desk used from an online ad - it's one of the good ol' SteelCase office
desks. I severely injured my toe hauling that thing into my basement and think
it's now permanently down there.

I mostly use a shop workbench in my garage with the door wide open when the
weather is decent enough. Working like this has been fantastic for wellbeing,
although the height of the workbench and the availability of good seating isn't
great.

### Computers

* MacBook Pro (2015) 13" Retina i7 3.1GHz/16GB. Arch Linux full time, but dual
  boot macOS.
  Daily driver. I've always ran on older, used computers.
* MacBook Pro M1 (work). Runs macOS. Daily Driver.
* Keyboard: [Logitech MX Mechanical Mini](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/mx-mechanical.html)

  year. I've tried most of 'em over the years and really don't mind any of them
  with a decent config and color scheme.

  work.
