## About Josh Beard

{% include submenu.html %}

See my [now page](/now) for a summary of what I'm up to lately.

### Personal

I'm from the 80's.

If you are looking at this and dig personal websites and that sort of thing,
say [hello](mailto:hello@joshbeard.me)! It'd be really cool to exchange a
"postcard" of sorts with people in e-mail.

As tempting as it is at times to share my opinions on political or social
topics, I generally refrain from doing so. There seems to be a dichotomy
between fashionable or approved opinions and all others. Politically and
socially, I align closest with libertarian principles. My belief is that
government is often not a benefactor, and the best authorities over my life are
those closest to me, like my family and myself. Despite living in what is
claimed to be an increasingly diverse and inclusive culture, I find myself
disenchanted by the pervasive uniformity, be it in website designs, fashion
trends, or social platitudes. At the same time, I place high value on tradition
and etiquette. As someone who is introverted and reserved, I avoid discussing
politics and similar topics in mixed company.

### The Good ol' Days

I've been a computer hobbyist since I was a kid/teen in the mid-late 90's, starting with
our [obsolete family computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PC_compatible_systems)
bought from a garage sale, the next family computer, and several other outdated
computers I collected from people back then.

I took an interest in Linux and Free and Open Source Software around 1999 and
became particuarily interested in setting up and administering servers and
websites. I've continued to use Linux every day, both professionally and as a
hobbiest.

In the early 2000's, I started using FreeBSD to experience another UNIXy systems
and ran it for several years on my desktop and home servers, eventually using
it for core services at a previous job.

I owe my career to Free and Open Source Software and the ecosystem built around
Linux and UNIX.

#### Home Servers

See [my Home Lab page](/homelab) for information about my servers at home.

### Professional Life

I was doing hobbyist stuff with servers and web apps in virtually all of my free
time prior to getting a career doing it. I joined the Army and did some level of
IT administration as part of my duties, but not so much traditional systems
administration or development. I later worked for Apple doing support and loved
any opportunity to use the UNIX underpinnings of their platform.

I got my real professional "foot in the door" of systems administration at a
school district several years ago. At that point, I had already been running
common services on Linux and FreeBSD for years for all sorts of things and had
some coding experience - at least shell, PHP, and web stuff. In that role, I
really honed my coding skills and gained experience with several types of
services, particularly e-mail services, file services, LDAP, and HTTP. There, I
learned Puppet, configuration management, version control, and lots of other
things, which launched me into a new phase of my career - 'DevOps'.

```

These days, my title is something about "DevOps" and I work on software
engineering teams to support and help make software.

I spend most of my day in a code editor and shell, bouncing across several
projects.
