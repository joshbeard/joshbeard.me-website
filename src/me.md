## About Josh Beard

{% include submenu.html %}

See my [now page](/now) for a summary of what I'm up to lately.

### Personal

Old soul.

If you are looking at this and dig personal websites and that sort of thing,
say [hello](mailto:hello@joshbeard.me)! It'd be really cool to exchange a
"postcard" of sorts with people in e-mail.

I live in [Colorado Springs, Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs%2C_Colorado).
I enjoy time with family, computers, outdoors (hiking, scenic drives), music
(listening ([last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/joshbeard), [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/hewbert007?si=52f6e599773a4cab)), watching, playing), food
(mostly just eating), games (card, party, board), and all sorts of other stuff.

I consider [Rapid City, South Dakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_City%2C_South_Dakota) my home.
I was born in and have family and roots in [Northeasten Arkansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Delta),
with most of my parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents generations around
Southeast Missouri, and Tennessee.  I hardly know anything about my family
history or ancestry. I've lived in Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Kansas,
Missouri, and South Dakota.

### Professional Life

I was doing hobbyist stuff with servers and web apps in virtually all of my free
time prior to getting a career doing it. I joined the Army and did some level of
IT administration as part of my duties, but not so much traditional systems
administration or development. I later worked for Apple doing support and loved
any opportunity to use the UNIX underpinnings of their platform.

I got my real professional "foot in the door" of systems administration at a
school district several years ago. At that point, I had already been running
common services on Linux and FreeBSD for years for all sorts of things and had
some coding experience - at least shell, PHP, and web stuff. In that role, I
really honed my coding skills and gained experience with several types of
services, particularly e-mail services, file services, LDAP, and HTTP. There, I
learned Puppet, configuration management, version control, and lots of other
things, which launched me into a new phase of my career - 'DevOps'.

These days, my title is something about "DevOps" and I work on software
engineering teams to support and help make software.

I spend most of my day in a code editor and shell, bouncing across several
projects.

I've been a computer hobbyist since I was a kid/teen in the mid-late 90's, starting with
our [obsolete family computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PC_compatible_systems)
bought from a garage sale, the next family computer, and several other outdated
computers I collected from people back then.

I took an interest in Linux and Free and Open Source Software around 1999 and
became particuarily interested in setting up and administering servers and
websites. I've continued to use Linux every day, both professionally and as a
hobbiest.

In the early 2000's, I started using FreeBSD to experience another UNIXy systems
and ran it for several years on my desktop and home servers, eventually using
it for core services at a previous job.

I owe my career to Free and Open Source Software and the ecosystem built around
Linux and UNIX.
