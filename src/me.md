## About Josh Beard

{% include submenu.html %}

See my [now page](/now) for a summary of what I'm up to lately.

### Personal

I'm from the 80's. My primary hobby interests are computers and music.

I live in Colorado with my beautiful wife and kids.
[Rapid City, South Dakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_City,_South_Dakota)
is our hometown, though I was born in
[North Eastern Arkansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Delta)
with roots in that area and the
[Missouri Bootheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Bootheel),
growing up there until the age of 6. I lived in
[Derby, Kansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby,_Kansas)
from ages 6-9 before moving to South Dakota. I also lived in [Western Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiteman_Air_Force_Base)
between 2000 and 2001. I've temporarily lived in a few other places over the
years. I have a fondness for all of these places.

If I travel for pleasure, I prefer driving over flying.

### Computers

I've been a computer hobbyist since I was a kid/teen in the mid-late 90's,
starting with our [obsolete family computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PC_compatible_systems)
bought from a garage sale, the next family computer, and several other outdated
computers I collected from people and found in the newspaper.

I took an interest in Linux and Free and Open Source Software around 1999 and
became particuarily interested in setting up and administering servers and
websites. I stayed up until dawn many nights learning and experimenting with
this stuff and hanging out on IRC.

Around 2004, I started using FreeBSD to experience another UNIX-derived system
and ran it for several years on my desktop and home servers, eventually using
it for core services at a previous job. Although I don't use it as much these
days, I still love it and have a lot of respect for it and its community.

I owe my career to Free and Open Source Software and the ecosystem built around
Linux and UNIX.

My professional background is in systems administration, but I've always
been a programmer on the side, though not as proficiently as I'd like.

These days, my title is something about "DevOps" and I work on software
engineering teams to support and help make software. A big focus of mine is
the overall process, workflow, and tools for developing, releasing, and
maintaining software projects. Some previous titles were Systems Administrator,
Systems Engineer, Help Desk, and computer guy.

I spend most of my day in a code editor and shell, bouncing across several
projects. The last few years has involved a lot of Terraform, Go, GitLab CI,
Python, Docker, shell, and various other tools and languages. At home, I've
been coding in Go pretty constantly since late 2022 and maintain a homelab
on Proxmox that's mostly maintained with Terraform and Ansible.

See [my resume](/resume) for more details about my professional experience.

### Music

Music has been a big part of my life for as long as I can remember. When I was
younger, I dreamed of being a musician, but pragmatism set in and I ended up
pursuing IT. I have several guitars, some little electronic gadgets, and an
electronic drum set that I play with.

I listen to a pretty diverse range of music, but rock and electronic are
the dominant broad genres. I don't have a single favorite band - it depends on
the mood. Some consistent favorites are Pink Floyd, Type O Negative, Tool,
Puscifer, Nine Inch Nails, Depeche Mode, The Cure, and... I hate to try to
enumerate them all. For electronic music, my favorite is probably Kruder &
Dorfmeister. I also like Orbital, Prodigy, Lords Of Acid, LTJ Bukem, and many
others. When it comes to country, I particularly like Waylon Jennings, Merle
Haggard, George Jones, and generally classic country. I also like a lot of 80's
and 90's country. I can't stand pop country or most modern pop music in
general.

stats (with lots of gaps) dating back to 2005.

### Politics and Culture

Although I occasionally feel the urge to express my opinions on political or
social issues, I typically hold back, confining such discussions to my family
or closest friends. I was more flippant online 20 years ago, when things
seemed a bit less consequential and the separation of online and offline was
more distinct. My stance has increasingly become contrarian against dominant
social, cultural, and political issues, trends, and ideologies, which I've
observed growing more authoritarian and dogmatic in recent years. Concurrently,
my own viewpoints have evolved significantly.

```

In terms of my political and social alignment, I resonate most with libertarian
principles, but it really depends on specific issues. I'm generally skeptical
of broad, centralized authority and collectivism. As for government, I'm wary
of oppression, _actual_ authoritarianism, and _actual_ totalitarianism. I have
a preference for authorities in my life to be as proximate and de-centralized
as possible.

Despite living in a society that professes increasing diversity and
inclusivity, I find culture becoming more and more superficial, monolithic, and
intolerant; less diverse and inclusive in actuality. Group think and conformity
are rampant.

I believe we're massively over-governed and that the contemporary obsession
with "safety" is overbearing and frustrating when applied to every arbitrary
aspect of life, especially in the context of "offensive" speech and expression.
I strongly believe in the right to either withhold an opinion or not have one
at all. I've had the privilege of knowing and working with people from all
sorts of backgrounds and wildly different perspectives.
