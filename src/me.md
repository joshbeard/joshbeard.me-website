## About Josh Beard

{% include submenu.html %}

See my [now page](/now) for a summary of what I'm up to lately.

### Personal

I'm from the 80's. My primary hobby interests are computers and music.

I live in Colorado with my wife and kids.
[Rapid City, South Dakota](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_City,_South_Dakota)
is our hometown, though I was born in
[North Eastern Arkansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Delta)
with roots in that area and the
[Missouri Bootheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Bootheel),
growing up there until the age of 6. I lived in
[Derby, Kansas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby,_Kansas)
from ages 6-9 before moving to South Dakota. I also lived in [Western Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiteman_Air_Force_Base)
between 2000 and 2001. I've temporarily lived in a few other places over the
years. I have a fondness for all of these places.

If I travel for pleasure, I prefer driving over flying.

I'm not interested in blogging here, and I don't maintain any social media
presence. I prefer to keep more quiet online these days, but I'll be extra
verbose on this site.

If you are looking at this and dig personal websites and that sort of thing,
say [hello](mailto:hello@joshbeard.me)!

### The Good ol' Days

I've been a computer hobbyist since I was a kid/teen in the mid-late 90's,
starting with our [obsolete family computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PC_compatible_systems)
bought from a garage sale, the next family computer, and several other outdated
computers I collected from people back then.

I took an interest in Linux and Free and Open Source Software around 1999 and
became particuarily interested in setting up and administering servers and
websites. I stayed up until dawn many nights learning and experimenting with
this stuff and hanging out on IRC.

Around 2003, I started using FreeBSD to experience another UNIX-derived system
and ran it for several years on my desktop and home servers, eventually using
it for core services at a previous job. Although I don't use it as much these
days, I still love it and have a lot of respect for it and its community.

I owe my career to Free and Open Source Software and the ecosystem built around
Linux and UNIX.

### Professional Life

I was doing hobbyist stuff with servers and web apps in virtually all of my free
time prior to getting a career doing it. I didn't go to college; in fact, I
dropped out of high school and got a GED. I joined the Army and did some level
of IT administration as part of my duties, but not so much traditional systems
administration or development. I later worked for Apple doing support and loved
any opportunity to use the UNIX/BSD side of their platform.

I got my formal start in systems administration at a school district several
years ago, sort of forcing my way into it as an eager young man. At that point,
I had already been running common services on Linux and FreeBSD for years for
all sorts of things and had some coding experience - at least shell, PHP, and
web stuff. In that role, I really honed my coding skills (by sysadmin standards)
and gained experience with several types of services, particularly
e-mail services, file services, LDAP, and HTTP. There, I learned Puppet,
configuration management, version control, and lots of other things, which
launched me into a new phase of my
career - 'DevOps'.

```

These days, my title is something about "DevOps" and I work on software
engineering teams to support and help make software. Some previous titles were
Systems Administrator, Systems Engineer, Help Desk, and computer guy.

I spend most of my day in a code editor and shell, bouncing across several
projects.

See [my resume](/resume) for more details about my professional experience.

### Politics and Culture

Although I occasionally feel the urge to express my opinions on political or
social issues, I typically hold back, confining such discussions to my family
or closest friends. I was more flippant online 20 years ago, when things
seemed a bit less consequential. My stance has increasingly become contrarian
against dominant social, cultural, and political issues, trends, and
ideologies, which I've observed growing more authoritarian and dogmatic in
recent years. Concurrently, my own viewpoints have evolved significantly.

        ) >     {_/,     /~)
snd     |/
```

In terms of my political and social alignment, I resonate most with libertarian
principles, but it really depends on specific issues. I'm generally skeptical
of broad, centralized authority and collectivism. As for government, I'm wary
of oppression, _actual_ authoritarianism, and _actual_ totalitarianism. I have
a preference for authorities in my life to be as proximate as possible ‚Äî
myself, my family, or local entities. Despite living in a society that
professes increasing diversity and inclusivity, I find myself disenchanted by
the widespread uniformity, whether it's the platitude of the week in political
rhetoric, social norms, or even in areas like website design and fashion
trends. Nevertheless, I place a high value on tradition and etiquette.
I strongly believe in the right to either withhold or not form an opinion.
