I keep seeing "complex" or "complicated" used as catch-alls for approaches
people don't fully understand. It's an easy label - sometimes just a reflex
when the bigger picture isn't clear. I think it's often the result of missing
perspective, context, or exposure to the problem space, and sometimes a lack of
foresight about where things are headed. Still, slapping those terms on
something without offering a real alternative feels empty - it's noise
pretending to be insight. I'm not pushing over-engineering or complexity for
the sake of it, but plenty of problems are complex. Solutions have to scale,
last, and tackle the messy unknowns and use cases they're meant for - no more
complex than needed, no less either.

Plenty of people think it's all simple when they're sketching the first 80%.
Looks clean and feels easy until the last 10-20% rolls in. Actually, I most
frequently hear this sentiment when it's all theory and the person claiming
it has hardly built anything towards the problem.
Edge cases, real-world mess, the stuff that breaks your tidy plan. That's where
"simple" gets tested, and it usually falls apart. Real simplicity comes from
working through the details and mastering them, showing up in the interface and
integration points. Ignoring the hard parts doesn't make them go away, it just
delays the reckoning.

I've seen too many "simple" approaches collapse after a few use cases or the
slightest curveball. They weren't simple; they were just incomplete. Then,
patching the gaps, complexity gets bolted on or sidestepped, and the mess grows
worse.

These "complex" and "complicated" labels are vague nonsense half the time - not
even measurable. People toss around that "genius admires simplicity, idiot
admires complexity" line like it's some deep truth proving their smarts. It's
not. It's a useless platitude.
