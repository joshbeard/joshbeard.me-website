## My old computers

{% include submenu.html %}

I haven't really kept track of the computers I've used over the
years. A summarized list is below - I may not have the exact model in a couple
of cases, but what's listed is pretty close. Between 1998 and 2004, my friends
and I acquired an assortment of parts, traded them, and built our own (obsolete)
computers from a pile of parts.

Many of these were used as home servers over the years. I ran my own e-mail
servers at home for several years, along with web servers and an assortment of
other things. I hosted e-mail and web content for myself mostly, but had a few
users and a couple of niche projects related to customizing
desktop environments.

I started using Linux on my desktop around 2000 and continued to until I started
exploring FreeBSD, which I ran on most of my workstations from 2004-2007 and most
of my homelab from 2004-2020. From there, It's been a mix of more Linux and
macOS on my workstations.
