  Photos from a hike at Herman Gulch, Colorado in September, 2018.
  This was a trail with plenty of beautiful scenery of mountain peaks, dense
  forest, open meadows, long views, creeks, and a lake. Though there was plenty
  of forest around, the trail was mostly exposed. It was not busy and fall was a
  great time of year to be there. Part of this trail is shared with the
  Continental Divide trail. Herman Lake is at the top, the presumed destination
  of this trail. However, there's lots to explore beyond the lake, including the
  base of Pettingell Peak.
